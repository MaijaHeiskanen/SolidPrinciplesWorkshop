# SolidPrinciplesWorkshop

I tried to follow https://github.com/Petsuri/SolidPrinciplesWorkshop/tree/master/SOLID.Principles.Workshop/SRP as strictly as I could, but there is some minor differences.
Overall the code is quite similar and should be as usable as the original for this exercise purposes. Not tested tho.

If you create new files and want to see if the code has errors (on runtime), import new files in `main.js`.

## Wanna run the app and get those errors?

Go to ./SRP and run `yarn install`.
Then you can run `yarn start` to run this app.

You will need Node installed if you want to run this. (Works at least with Node version 14.17.5, others not tested)
This is not doing anything tho.

# SolidPrinciplesWorkshop

I tried to follow https://github.com/Petsuri/SolidPrinciplesWorkshop/tree/master/SOLID.Principles.Workshop/SRP as strictly as I could, but there is some minor differences, mostly with the http request.
Overall the code is quite similar and should be as usable as the original for this exercise purposes. Not tested tho.

## JavaScript or TypeScript?

Lucky you, both are available. As you may guess, the JavaScript version in `./SRP` folder and the TypeScript version in `./SRP-typed` folder.

## How to run the app?

Go to `./SRP` or `./SRP-typed` and run `yarn install`.
Then you can run `yarn start` to run this app.
It will run the app again automatically when a file in `./src` folder is edited (and saved).

You will need Node installed if you want to run this. (Works at least with Node version 14.17.5, others not tested). The app is not doing anything tho, but running the app will give you feedback if there is syntax errors etc. in the code.
